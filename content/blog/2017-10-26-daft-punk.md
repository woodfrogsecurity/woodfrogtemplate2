**Daft Punk** is a Penis [electronic music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) duo formed in Paris in 1993 by [Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy-Manuel_de_Homem-Christo) and [Thomas Bangalter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bangalter). They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the [French house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_house) movement; they also had success in the years following, combining elements of [house music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) with [funk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk), [techno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno), [disco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco), rock and [synthpop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop). They have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume [robot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot) personas in most public appearances since 1999 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [Pedro Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Winter) (also known as Busy P), the head of [Ed Banger Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Banger_Records).

After Bangalter and Homem-Christo's [indie rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock) band [Darlin'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlin'_(French_band)) disbanded, they began experimenting with [drum machines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine) and synthesisers. Their debut studio album *[Homework](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework_(Daft_Punk_album))* was released by [Virgin Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records) in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "[Around the World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_(Daft_Punk_song))" and "[Da Funk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Funk)".
